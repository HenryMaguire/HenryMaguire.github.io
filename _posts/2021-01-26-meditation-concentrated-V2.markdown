Meditation has experienced a boom in popularity over the last decade. There is now an overwhelming amount of scientific (and anecdotal) evidence on the psychological benefits of meditation, with apps such as Headspace and Calm helping to make it readily available to everyone. The meditation industry is now estimated to be worth over a billion dollars worldwide, with courses, retreats and apps catering for everything from sports performance to phobias.

Despite this publicity, I still meet very few people that meditate regularly. Some people get a lot out of meditation, but aren't able to establish a habit. Some have tried meditation, but upon failing to "clear their mind", concluded that it's not for them. Others simply assume that it _can't really have that much of an effect_ or are put off by its spiritual affiliations.

In many cases, there has been a general lack of communication about what meditation actually _is_. Although apps have done wonders for getting people to try meditation, they seem reluctant to explain it clearly. I guess their subscription models give them little incentive to teach the tools to become self-sufficient...

> _Where there is mystery, there is margin._ 

On top of this, I don't feel like the true benefits of meditation are talked about enough. I have found them hard to ignore.

I started to meditate in 2016, in the midst of a particularly bad bout of depression, having struggled with concentration problems, anxiety and depersonalisation since I was a teenager. Like most people, my first port of call was Headspace, which mainly teaches a mixture of two meditation styles: _mindfulness_ and _focus_ (more on these later). I found it exceedingly difficult, but after just a few weeks of about 10-15 minutes a day, I could already notice the difference. My concentration was improving, my anxiety reducing. I felt happier, more connected to the world. I was seeing my surroundings more vividly. I was hooked. I learned as much as I could and crafted my own unguided practice.

Several years on, my concentration problems, general anxiety and depersonalisation disorder have all but faded. This has brought unimaginable improvements to my life and I often find it hard to believe.

Interestingly, despite all of the improvements I've experienced, I have continued to suffer from frequent bouts of depression. I had started to assume that meditation wouldn't help me with this. More recently I stumbled upon a different style of meditation and incorporated it into my practice. It is less popular than _focus_ and _mindfulness_ styles, but recent research suggests that it is a powerful treatment for depression and my own experience backs this up. I'm slowly starting to realise that...

> _not all meditation is made equally_

But, how can something so benign have such profound effects? What are these different styles of meditation and why does the brain respond so differently to them? How can people design their own practice that caters to their own wellbeing?

Let's find out.

**Disclaimers: I'm not an expert, I am just a keen hobbyist that has read a few books and experimented over time. Meditation is only supplementary to (not a substitute for) proper medical treatment, so if you have a serious mental health condition, please seek professional help.**

## Stuff

- Explain how the overwhelming number of different meditation on offer can be broadly broken down into four categories.
Striving for self-sufficiency and efficiency, I soon delved into the literature surrounding mindfulness and focus meditation and crafted an unguided routine based on these two disciplines.

That is until the last few months, when I stumbled across a third style of meditation known as "open heart" and incorporated it into my practice. I have really been blown away by the impact that it has had on my mood.

I now get immense satisfaction every day from a simple unguided meditation.  This meditation addresses specific parts of my own wellbeing, drawing on neurological research. what I have learnedbut it is modular so it can be adapted for differing needs. The benefits that I've experienced from this simple practice really have been incalculable and I would like to show everyone how to do the same.

That is until I recently reread/read  and [Into The Magic Shop](https://amzn.to/2M9rcyD) by Dr Jim Doty. 

Despite being so simple, anybody that has ever tried these two exercises will know that they are deceptively hard. The disobedience of your own mind never fails to surprise you and it can bring waves of emotional turmoil, even anger and frustration. However, 
it has sparked a deep interest to find out _"how on Earth is this possible?"_


# The Four Categories of Meditation 

Here I will summarise "Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain" by Dr Jeff Tarrant.
Two of the most common styles of m: mindfulness and concentration. I will delve further into these below, but they are by far the most common and make up the majority of app-based meditations, as well as many traditional styles such as Vipassana (from what I gather). My own experience of practicing these, for as little as 5-10 minutes a day, is that they are extremely effective at treating concentration problems and anxiety.

### Focus meditation
Focus meditation is summarised extremely succinctly in _Meditation Interventions_:

_"Focus meditations involve a voluntary and sustained attention on a chosen object, such as the breath, a part of the body, a strong visual image or a word or phrase. When the attention wanders from this object, the goal is to recognise this as soon as possible and without judgment return attention to the original focus."_

Research has shown the focus meditations increase activation in various aspects of the brain, but importantly in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex. This means that focus forms of meditation are the perfect antidote for the stereotypical under-activated patterns seen in ADHD. Even for people without attention disorders, focus meditation has been shown to improve concentration, memory problems, self-monitoring, cognitive self-awareness and mental stability, with effects observed in just a matter of weeks.

Take for example, ADD/ADHD. [List symptoms], [list problematic lifestyle factors]. Neurobiologically, this is commonly characterised by an under-activated Prefrontal Cortex (specifically the Anterior Cingulate Cortex). In-fact, specific patterns of under-activation seen with EEG now have FDA approval as a reliable method for detecting the disorder. The stimulation-seeking behaviour that is typical of people with attention-deficit disorder seems to be the under-activated brain's way of becoming more activated. This is the reason that stimulants such as Ritalin are used to treat ADHD, because they stimulate the frontal areas of the brain - a fact that is counter-intuitive unless you look at the neurobiology.

Focus meditation exactly as described here makes up about 65% of my entire practice.

### Mindfulness meditation

_"Mindfulness meditations... involve a dispassionate, non-evaluative awareness of ongoing experience, open presence, a non-judgmental awareness of sensory, cognitive and affective experiences as it arises in the present moment."_


One side-effect of the fact that humans are such intelligent, abstract thinkers is that on top of the external threats we experience in our every day lives, we also get to construct hypothetical threats within the comfort of our own minds, by projecting our hopes and fears out into the past and future. A common trait of anxiety is that it causes sufferers to treat these projections and stories as real existential threats, with their nervous system preparing the fight-or-flight response on an almost continuous basis - often in response to minor social or environmental triggers. Humans are able to ruminate on our thoughts and memories, so the stress associated with these triggers can linger for long after the initial situation arises. This is in stark contrast to other species in the animal kingdom, that might have a visceral response whilst under threat, but return back to normality extremely rapidly as the adrenaline leaves their blood stream.

From a neurological perspective, anxiety is understood largely by the interaction between the brain's emotional centre, known as Limbic System or "lizard brain", and the Prefrontal Cortex, which is where lots of the logical decision-making gets made. The Limbic System is mainly comprised of the amygdala and the hippocampus and is responsible for the expression of primal emotions such as fear and anger, the retrieval of emotional memories and engaging the "fight-or-flight" response to threats. In a simplistic view, it's the job of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex to mediate the communication between the Limbic System and the Prefrontal Cortex. In the brain, anxiety is often characterised by an _over-active Cingulate Cortex_ that is not able to regulate the activity of the known as the limbic system.

It just so happens that Mindfulness meditation has been shown to be beneficial for these types of brain patterns. Quietening down a hot cingulate cortex. Strengthening the regulatory power of the prefrontal cortex, which allows greater awareness and control over negative emotions and memories.

Mindfulness has a focus component, as one must have control over where they place their attention. This means that it's recommended that beginners start with focus meditation. You might be thinking that "shouldn't we be quietening down a hot cingulate, not heating it up?!" but Tarrant says that generally you cannot aggravate fast brainwave patterns with focus meditation. Many people with fast brain patterns also have difficulty focusing their attention, with too many things coming and going through their mind. For this reason, it is advised that if you suffer from anxiety then you should start with focus meditation and then incorporate mindfulness later.


### Open Heart meditation
In [[Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain]], Tarrant states that the depressed brain tends to have less activation on the left, which can be used as a marker for potential mood related issues.
Now that we have seen how a link can be made between psychological disorders and brain activation, now I will summarise the four different meditation styles as outlined by Tarrant. 
There is an undeniable common theme between all different types of meditation: to practice not identifying with your thoughts. However, research has shown that the way you use your awareness during the practice changes the effect it has on your brain. By understanding this, you can

# Common misconceptions

### Misconception 1: In order to successfully meditate, I must "clear my mind" and not get distracted
Engrained into this is the notion that meditation is some passive, static state that you attain once you have simply filtered out all of the active thinking.

- That there is essentially one type of meditation and it's all just "good for you".
- Meditation is hard, or hard to define.

Beliefs I want to instil:
- Meditation is a deeply active and dynamic _process_. In focus meditation, it is a cycle between activity of the DMN and the ACC.
- Getting distracted, and noticing it, is something to celebrate immensely. Every time you catch yourself doing it, even if you've been lost in thought for 4 minutes of your guided meditation, once you notice and bring yourself back you should be applauding yourself.
- That there are four main types of meditation and each of them has slightly different benefits. 
- The aim of meditation is very rarely to "clear your mind" - in Quiet Mind meditations. I wouldn't recommend these for beginners anyway. Normally, there is a clearly defined "object" you are focussing your attention on.
- For about 80% of cases, meditation could consist of just focusing on your breath for anywhere from 1 to 60 minutes a day. The same specific sensation, not exploring different aspects. Every time you get distracted, gently and without judgement bringing your focus back to the breath.

# Conclusions

I'd like to stress here how incredibly difficult I found Focus and Mindfulness meditation when I first started Headspace back in 2016. My own specific mental health at the time was unbelievably poor as I was suffering from some anxiety-induced attentional disorder, as well as moderate depression. Any attempt to focus on any particular thing was essentially futile. Any attempt to observe thoughts and feelings inevitably caused me to get wrapped up in some negative self-narrative. But over time, day-by-day, I persevered. Week by week, I could notice differences. The world seemed more vivid, clearer. I could focus for longer periods of time, with less stimulation and without drifting into anxious self-talk. I was starting to notice stories that I was telling myself and simply chuckle at thoughts. With meditation, much like any good habit, it's the compounding benefits over time which make it truly magical.


My approach until recently, was two typical exercises: Focusing on my breath. Body scanning, which is a popular "mindfulness". This is a very typical "stack" of exercises that comprise much of the meditations in the major apps. Indeed these two forms of exercise are overwhelmingly beneficial, as I'll present below. I had always found that they massively helped with attention problems, anxiety and overall mental stability, but ultimately did very little for dealing with depression - apart from the indirect benefits due to living a more calm and enjoyable life. I accepted this as a fact of life, that "meditation couldn't really help me feel less depressed"
Recently, I re-read [[Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain]] by Dr Jeff Tarrant (a clinical psychologist that specialises in neuroscience-backed approaches to treating psychological disorders). In this book he introduces modern neuroscience research into the effects of meditation and argues that any style of meditation can be roughly categorised into four systems. advises clinicians on which styles to use for different conditions.
