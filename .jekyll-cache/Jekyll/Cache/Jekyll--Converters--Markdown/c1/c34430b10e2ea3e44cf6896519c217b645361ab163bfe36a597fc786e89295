I"ü2<p>It is certainly true that meditation has experienced a major boom in popularity over the last few decades. This has been driven by a plethora of scientific (and anecdotal) evidence that meditation can bring a vast swathe of psychological benefits. Clever marketing and UX design has meant that apps such as Headspace and Calm have become increasingly popular. The meditation industry is now estimated to be worth over a billion dollars worldwide - with courses, retreats and subscription services packaging up wellbeing in ever more elaborate ways, catering for everything from sports performance to confidence issues.</p>

<p>Despite this increase in publicity, I still meet very few people that meditate regularly. In part, I think this is because there is still some ‚Äúnew-age‚Äù stigma that lingers, but I think the problem lies in a lack of communication about what meditation actually <em>is</em>. On top of this, I think that the vagueness with which most apps and courses approach the topic does little to dispel the many prevalent myths and assumptions about meditation that put people off. Apps have done wonders for getting people to try meditation, but I feel that their subscription model gives them no incentive to teach people to become self-sufficient. I suspect that this unwillingness to foster independence in subscribers/students/customers is to blame for some of the over-complicated packaging that meditation often finds itself in.</p>

<p>I have meditated since 2016, and during that time there have been many moments where I have realised that meditation is actually less complicated than I thought. Some of this simplicity has emerged from putting in hours and hours of practice, but a great deal has come from reading scientific literature and books and listening to podcasts. In this article I aim to package up all of the things I have learnt about meditation along the way, to help others fast-track their way towards enlightenment.</p>

<p>First, I will try to dispel some common myths that I encounter.</p>

<h3 id="myth-1-in-order-to-successfully-meditate-i-must-to-clear-my-mind-and-not-get-distracted">Myth 1: In order to successfully meditate, I must to ‚Äúclear my mind‚Äù and not get distracted</h3>
<ul>
  <li>That meditation is some passive, static state that you attain once you have simply filtered out all of the active thinking.</li>
  <li>That there is essentially one type of meditation and it‚Äôs all just ‚Äúgood for you‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Meditation is hard, or hard to define.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beliefs I want to instil:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meditation is a deeply active and dynamic <em>process</em>. In focus meditation, it is a cycle between activity of the DMN and the ACC.</li>
  <li>Getting distracted, and noticing it, is something to celebrate immensely. Every time you catch yourself doing it, even if you‚Äôve been lost in thought for 4 minutes of your guided meditation, once you notice and bring yourself back you should be applauding yourself.</li>
  <li>That there are four main types of meditation and each of them has slightly different benefits.</li>
  <li>The aim of meditation is very rarely to ‚Äúclear your mind‚Äù - in Quiet Mind meditations. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these for beginners anyway. Normally, there is a clearly defined ‚Äúobject‚Äù you are focussing your attention on.</li>
  <li>For about 80% of cases, meditation could consist of just focusing on your breath for anywhere from 1 to 60 minutes a day. The same specific sensation, not exploring different aspects. Every time you get distracted, gently and without judgement bringing your focus back to the breath.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the outsiders perspective, meditation can seem extreme elusive. I have spoken to numerous people that have tried one of the major apps, or attended a 40 minute session at a local meditation centre, but after feeling like they couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúclear their mind‚Äù they concluded that meditation simply wasn‚Äôt for them. Often the meditation apps and courses themselves don‚Äôt push this ‚Äúclear your mind‚Äù rhetoric, but the vagueness with which they approach the topic does little to dispel these myths and assumptions, which have engrained themselves deeply into mainstream society.</p>

<p>Another very common story I hear is that people feel like they are <em>failing</em> at meditation, because they keep getting distracted. Wrapped up in this is an assumption that meditation is some static <em>state</em> that you can attain, but only once you have managed to settle all of the activity in your mind.</p>

<p>In this article, I‚Äôm going to try to convince you that:</p>

<p>At least that has been my experience. It took me about 20 hours of Headspace, reading articles, listening to podcasts with meditation experts and neuroscientists, etc. to realise that there was some underlying simplicity to it all. 
I now get immense satisfaction from a very simple unguided meditation that I devised myself that addresses specific parts of my wellbeing. I also feel like I have the knowledge to improve it over time depending on my needs. My aim for this article is to teach you how to do the same.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of what I will write about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An overview of neuroscience findings related to three of the most prevalent  psychological disorders: attentional-deficit disorder, anxiety and depression.</li>
  <li>An overview of the four fundamental styles of meditation: focus, mindfulness, quiet mind and open heart and how each of them can be used to treat the above disorders.</li>
  <li>Four simple meditations that you can use to create a meditation practice catered for your own specific wellbeing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disclaimers: I‚Äôm not an expert, I am just a keen hobbyist that has learnt and experimented over time. Meditation is only supplementary to (not a substitute for) proper medical treatment, so if you have a serious mental health condition, such as severe depression or OCD, seek professional help alongside any meditation practice.</strong></p>

<p>My approach until recently, was two typical exercises: Focusing on my breath. Body scanning, which is a popular ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù. This is a very typical ‚Äústack‚Äù of exercises that comprise much of the meditations in the major apps. Indeed these two forms of exercise are overwhelmingly beneficial, as I‚Äôll present below. I had always found that they massively helped with attention problems, anxiety and overall mental stability, but ultimately did very little for dealing with depression - apart from the indirect benefits due to living a more calm and enjoyable life. I accepted this as a fact of life, that ‚Äúmeditation couldn‚Äôt really help me feel less depressed‚Äù
Recently, I re-read [[Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain]] by Dr Jeff Tarrant (a clinical psychologist that specialises in neuroscience-backed approaches to treating psychological disorders). In this book he introduces modern neuroscience research into the effects of meditation and argues that any style of meditation can be roughly categorised into four systems. advises clinicians on which styles to use for different conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of the four styles here</strong></p>

<p>Before introducing the styles of meditation, it becomes useful to think about some common problems that arise in the brain, and particular markers.
[[ADHD]]
Take for example, ADD/ADHD. [List symptoms], [list problematic lifestyle factors]. Neurobiologically, this is commonly characterised by an under-activated Prefrontal Cortex (specifically the Anterior Cingulate Cortex) #Fact-check. In-fact, specific patterns of under-activation seen with EEG now have FDA approval as a reliable method for detecting the disorder. The stimulation-seeking behaviour that is typical of people with attention-deficit disorder seems to be the under-activated brain‚Äôs way of becoming more activated. This is the reason that stimulants such as Ritalin are used to treat ADHD, because they stimulate the frontal areas of the brain - a fact that is counter-intuitive unless you look at the neurobiology.
[[Anxiety]]
One side-effect of the fact that humans are such intelligent, abstract thinkers is that on top of the external threats we experience in our every day lives, we also get to construct hypothetical threats within the comfort of our own nervous systems, by projecting our hopes and fears out into the past and future. A common trait of anxiety is that it causes sufferers to treat these projections and stories as real existential threats, with the nervous system preparing the fight-or-flight response on an almost continuous basis, or in response to minor social or environmental triggers.
The brain‚Äôs emotional centre, known as [[Limbic System]] or ‚Äúlizard brain‚Äù, is mainly comprised of the amygdala and the hippocampus and is responsible for the expression of primal emotions such as fear and anger, the retrieval of emotional memories and engaging the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù response to threats.
The brain‚Äôs [[Prefrontal Cortex]] is where lots of the logical decision-making gets made, and it‚Äôs the job of the [[Anterior Cingulate Cortex]] to mediate the communication between the [[Limbic System]] and the [[Prefrontal Cortex]].
In the brain, anxiety is often characterised by an over-active [[Cingulate Cortex]] that is not able to regulate the activity of the known as the limbic system. 
[[Depression]]
In [[Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain]], Tarrant states that the depressed brain tends to have less activation on the left, which can be used as a marker for potential mood related issues.
Now that we have seen how a link can be made between psychological disorders and brain activation, now I will summarise the four different meditation styles as outlined by Tarrant. 
There is an undeniable common theme between all different types of meditation: to practice not identifying with your thoughts. However, research has shown that the way you use your awareness during the practice changes the effect it has on your brain. By understanding this, you can 
Focus
‚ÄúFocus meditations involve a voluntary and sustained attention on a chosen object, such as the breath, a part of the body, a strong visual image or a word or phrase. When the attention wanders from this object, the goal is to recognise this as soon as possible and without judgment return attention to the original focus.‚Äù
Research has shown the focus meditations increase activation various aspects of the brain, but importantly in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (Travis &amp; Shear, 2010). This means that focus forms of meditation are the perfect antidote for the stereotypical under-activated patterns seen in ADHD. Even for people without attention disorders, focus meditation has been shown to improve concentration, memory problems, self-monitoring, cognitive self-awareness and mental stability, with effects observed in just a matter of weeks.
Mindfulness
‚ÄúMindfulness meditations‚Ä¶ involve a dispassionate, non-evaluative awareness of ongoing experience, open presence, a non-judgmental awareness of sensory cognitive and affective experiences as it arises in the present moment.‚Äù
Mindfulness has a focus component, as one must have control over where they place their attention. This means that it‚Äôs recommended that beginners start with focus.
Quietening down a hot cingulate cortex. Strengthening the regulatory power of the prefrontal cortex, which allows greater awareness and control over negative emotions and memories.
Purists might think that focusing on the personal developments of meditation defeats the point, as treating it a means to an end means you can‚Äôt be fully present. This is a good point. There really is a fine line, however setting up a meditation practice that you can reap long term benefits from. When you are meditating, you are treating it as an end in itself.
I‚Äôd like to stress here how incredibly difficult I found Focus and Mindfulness meditation when I first started Headspace back in 2016. My own specific mental health at the time was unbelievably poor as I was suffering from some anxiety-induced attentional disorder, as well as moderate depression. Any attempt to focus on any particular thing was essentially futile. Any attempt to observe thoughts and feelings inevitably caused me to get wrapped up in some negative self-narrative. But over time, day-by-day, I persevered. Week by week, I could notice differences. The world seemed more vivid, clearer. I could focus for longer periods of time, with less stimulation and without drifting into anxious self-talk. I was starting to notice stories that I was telling myself and simply chuckle at thoughts. With meditation, much like any good habit, it‚Äôs the compounding benefits over time which make it truly magical.
