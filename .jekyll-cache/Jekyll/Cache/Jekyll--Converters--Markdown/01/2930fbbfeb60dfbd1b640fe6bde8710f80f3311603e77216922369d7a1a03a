I"]%<p>It is certainly true that meditation has experienced a major boom in popularity in the last few decades, with apps like Headspace and Calm becoming increasingly popular. This has been driven by multiple factor, such as scientific (and anecdotal) claims that meditation can bring a vast swathes of benefits, as well as clever marketing by the apps themselves. Meditition is now estimated to be a billion dollar industry, packaging up wellbeing in ever more elaborate ways, with guided meditations and courses being offered to target very specific issues.</p>

<p>From the outsiders perspective, meditation can seem extreme elusive. I have spoken to numerous people that have tried one of the major apps, or attended a 40 minute session at a local meditation centre, but after feeling like they couldn’t “clear their mind” they concluded that meditation simply wasn’t for them. Or they have felt that because they are constantly getting distracted, then they are in some way <em>failing</em> at meditation. In this article I’m going to challenge some of these misconceptions.</p>

<p>Often the apps and courses themselves don’t push this “clear your mind” rhetoric, but the vagueness with which they approach the topic does little to dispel these myths and assumptions about meditation that have engrained themselves into society.</p>

<p>At least that has been my experience. It took me about 20 hours of Headspace, reading articles, listening to podcasts with meditation experts and neuroscientists, etc. to realise that there was some underlying simplicity to it all. 
I now get immense satisfaction from a very simple unguided meditation that I devised myself that addresses specific parts of my wellbeing. I also feel like I have the knowledge to improve it over time depending on my needs. My aim for this article is to teach you how to do the same.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of what I will write about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An overview of neuroscience findings related to three of the most prevalent  psychological disorders: attentional-deficit disorder, anxiety and depression.</li>
  <li>An overview of the four fundamental styles of meditation: focus, mindfulness, quiet mind and open heart and how each of them can be used to treat the above disorders.</li>
  <li>Four simple meditations that you can use to create a meditation practice catered for your own specific wellbeing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disclaimers: I’m not an expert, I am just a keen hobbyist that has learnt and experimented over time. Meditation is only supplementary to (not a substitute for) proper medical treatment, so if you have a serious mental health condition, such as severe depression or OCD, seek professional help.</strong></p>

<p>My approach until recently, was two typical exercises: Focusing on my breath. Body scanning, which is a popular “mindfulness”. This is a very typical “stack” of exercises that comprise much of the meditations in the major apps. Indeed these two forms of exercise are overwhelmingly beneficial, as I’ll present below. I had always found that they massively helped with attention problems, anxiety and overall mental stability, but ultimately did very little for dealing with depression - apart from the indirect benefits due to living a more calm and enjoyable life. I accepted this as a fact of life, that “meditation couldn’t really help me feel less depressed”
Recently, I re-read [[Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain]] by Dr Jeff Tarrant (a clinical psychologist that specialises in neuroscience-backed approaches to treating psychological disorders). In this book he introduces modern neuroscience research into the effects of meditation and argues that any style of meditation can be roughly categorised into four systems. advises clinicians on which styles to use for different conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of the four styles here</strong></p>

<p>Before introducing the styles of meditation, it becomes useful to think about some common problems that arise in the brain, and particular markers.
[[ADHD]]
Take for example, ADD/ADHD. [List symptoms], [list problematic lifestyle factors]. Neurobiologically, this is commonly characterised by an under-activated Prefrontal Cortex (specifically the Anterior Cingulate Cortex) #Fact-check. In-fact, specific patterns of under-activation seen with EEG now have FDA approval as a reliable method for detecting the disorder. The stimulation-seeking behaviour that is typical of people with attention-deficit disorder seems to be the under-activated brain’s way of becoming more activated. This is the reason that stimulants such as Ritalin are used to treat ADHD, because they stimulate the frontal areas of the brain - a fact that is counter-intuitive unless you look at the neurobiology.
[[Anxiety]]
One side-effect of the fact that humans are such intelligent, abstract thinkers is that on top of the external threats we experience in our every day lives, we also get to construct hypothetical threats within the comfort of our own nervous systems, by projecting our hopes and fears out into the past and future. A common trait of anxiety is that it causes sufferers to treat these projections and stories as real existential threats, with the nervous system preparing the fight-or-flight response on an almost continuous basis, or in response to minor social or environmental triggers.
The brain’s emotional centre, known as [[Limbic System]] or “lizard brain”, is mainly comprised of the amygdala and the hippocampus and is responsible for the expression of primal emotions such as fear and anger, the retrieval of emotional memories and engaging the “fight-or-flight” response to threats.
The brain’s [[Prefrontal Cortex]] is where lots of the logical decision-making gets made, and it’s the job of the [[Anterior Cingulate Cortex]] to mediate the communication between the [[Limbic System]] and the [[Prefrontal Cortex]].
In the brain, anxiety is often characterised by an over-active [[Cingulate Cortex]] that is not able to regulate the activity of the known as the limbic system. 
[[Depression]]
In [[Meditation Interventions to Rewire the Brain]], Tarrant states that the depressed brain tends to have less activation on the left, which can be used as a marker for potential mood related issues.
Now that we have seen how a link can be made between psychological disorders and brain activation, now I will summarise the four different meditation styles as outlined by Tarrant. 
There is an undeniable common theme between all different types of meditation: to practice not identifying with your thoughts. However, research has shown that the way you use your awareness during the practice changes the effect it has on your brain. By understanding this, you can 
Focus
“Focus meditations involve a voluntary and sustained attention on a chosen object, such as the breath, a part of the body, a strong visual image or a word or phrase. When the attention wanders from this object, the goal is to recognise this as soon as possible and without judgment return attention to the original focus.”
Research has shown the focus meditations increase activation various aspects of the brain, but importantly in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (Travis &amp; Shear, 2010). This means that focus forms of meditation are the perfect antidote for the stereotypical under-activated patterns seen in ADHD. Even for people without attention disorders, focus meditation has been shown to improve concentration, memory problems, self-monitoring, cognitive self-awareness and mental stability, with effects observed in just a matter of weeks.
Mindfulness
“Mindfulness meditations… involve a dispassionate, non-evaluative awareness of ongoing experience, open presence, a non-judgmental awareness of sensory cognitive and affective experiences as it arises in the present moment.”
Mindfulness has a focus component, as one must have control over where they place their attention. This means that it’s recommended that beginners start with focus.
Quietening down a hot cingulate cortex. Strengthening the regulatory power of the prefrontal cortex, which allows greater awareness and control over negative emotions and memories.
Purists might think that focusing on the personal developments of meditation defeats the point, as treating it a means to an end means you can’t be fully present. This is a good point. There really is a fine line, however setting up a meditation practice that you can reap long term benefits from. When you are meditating, you are treating it as an end in itself.
I’d like to stress here how incredibly difficult I found Focus and Mindfulness meditation when I first started Headspace back in 2016. My own specific mental health at the time was unbelievably poor as I was suffering from some anxiety-induced attentional disorder, as well as moderate depression. Any attempt to focus on any particular thing was essentially futile. Any attempt to observe thoughts and feelings inevitably caused me to get wrapped up in some negative self-narrative. But over time, day-by-day, I persevered. Week by week, I could notice differences. The world seemed more vivid, clearer. I could focus for longer periods of time, with less stimulation and without drifting into anxious self-talk. I was starting to notice stories that I was telling myself and simply chuckle at thoughts. With meditation, much like any good habit, it’s the compounding benefits over time which make it truly magical.
